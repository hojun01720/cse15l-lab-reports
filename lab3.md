# Lab  3

I found interesting command-line options for command `find`. <br/><br/>
  1. First option is `type`. It can find file, directory, or other things based on the input.<br/>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp `-type f` finds and returns files. `-type d` finds and returns the directory. <br/>
     * Example of using `-type f` <br/>
